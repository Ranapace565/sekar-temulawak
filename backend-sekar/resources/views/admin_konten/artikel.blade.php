                <p class="lead">Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the utility-first
                    classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals,
                    datepickers.</p>
                <p>Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some ideas in a sketchbook. This way,
                    you can think things through before committing to an actual design project.</p>
                <p>But then I found a <a href="https://flowbite.com">component library based on Tailwind CSS called
                        Flowbite</a>. It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as buttons, navigation
                    bars, cards, form elements, and more which are conveniently built with the utility classes from
                    Tailwind CSS.</p>

                <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
                <p>First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This library is not another framework.
                    Rather, it is a set of components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from the
                    documentation.</p>
                <p>It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive components, such as modals, dropdowns,
                    and datepickers which you can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.</p>
                <p>You can check out the <a href="https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart/">quickstart
                        guide</a> to explore the elements by including the CDN files into your project. But if you want
                    to build a project with Flowbite I recommend you to follow the build tools steps so that you can
                    purge and minify the generated CSS.</p>
                <p>You'll also receive a lot of useful application UI, marketing UI, and e-commerce pages that can help
                    you get started with your projects even faster. You can check out this <a
                        href="https://flowbite.com/docs/components/tables/">comparison table</a> to better understand
                    the differences between the open-source and pro version of Flowbite.</p>
